# tinyHello
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/NoelXP/tinyHello.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/NoelXP/tinyHello)

Docker container project. Building a container that is able to open a tiny helloworld flask servlet

Current pipeline set-up: Any commit to github is picked up and built/tested using circleci

Localchanges -> git -> gitHub -> circleCI for testing -> build server (my local computer for now) -> dockerHub

Eventually going to migrate to a jenkins server solution.

Adding another Branch.


Right now we have master, which will only merge by Luke, a build branch, and a feature branch.
